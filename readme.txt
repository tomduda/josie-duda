josie is a responsive modern design theme designed and developed by Thomas Francis Duda. 

josie\'s design is focussed on typography and aims to put the content front and center. Fonts are large and clear and scale according to screen width. On wider screens blockquotes and images can be aligned left and right to break out of the main stream and get a pull-quote effect. The featured images are responsive through the use of the <picture> element resulting in appropriate image sizes being loaded to fit individual screen sizes.

It is january first and I just wanted to check in on an alternate computer.
